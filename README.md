# Wait, where are your repositories?
Well, from the past while I've been [moving my digital life away from Big Tech](https://jojo.garden/notes/moving-away-from-big-tech/) and this includes GitHub.

> Big Tech companies are profit-driven, massive scale, privacy intrusive and closed source. I want to break out of that. I want small scale, community-driven, cooperatives, privacy aware and open source solutions.

While I'll keep my account active for work and checking open source, _my own_ projects will live on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/jonatabaldin) â€“ a democratic, community-driven and non-profit Gitea hosting platform.

The repositories I had on GitHub were quite stale, so I just saved a copy [here](https://codeberg.org/jonatasbaldin/old-code/). If necessary, I can move a project to its own repository.

You can also find me at [jojo.garden](https://jojo.garden) and [mastodon](https://indieweb.social/web/@jonatasbaldin).

> If you think about doing something simillar but are afraid about the consequences, please get in touch. I'd love to chat about it.
