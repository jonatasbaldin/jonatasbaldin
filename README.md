## Wait, where are all your repositories?
Short answer: [here](https://codeberg.org/jonatasbaldin/old-code/).

Well, from the past while I've been [moving my digital life away from Big Tech](https://jojo.garden/moving-away-from-big-tech/) and this includes GitHub.

While I'll keep my account active for work and checking open source, _my own_ projects will live on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/jonatasbaldin) â€“ a democratic, community-driven and non-profit Gitea hosting platform.

You can also find me at [jojo.garden](https://jojo.garden).
